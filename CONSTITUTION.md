# Tracker-SDK Constitution

This document is the formal constitutional articulation of the rules
encoded in `CLAUDE.md`. All articles below are binding on every commit,
every pull request, and every release tag in this submodule.

## Article 1: Inherited Rules

This submodule inherits all constitutional rules from the parent Lava
project at https://github.com/milos85vasic/Lava/blob/master/CLAUDE.md.
Read that file first; this constitution adds rules specific to this
submodule and does not relax any inherited rule.

The following inherited rules are binding:

- **Sixth Law (clauses 6.A–6.F)** — all anti-bluff testing requirements.
  Tests in this submodule must traverse the same surfaces a consumer
  touches; falsifiability rehearsals are recorded; capability honesty
  applies (a primitive that exposes a feature must work).
- **Seventh Law (all 7 clauses)** — anti-bluff enforcement. Bluff-Audit
  stamps on every test commit; real-stack verification gate; pre-tag
  attestation; forbidden test patterns; recurring bluff hunts; bluff
  discovery protocol; recursive inheritance to all submodules.
- **Local-Only CI/CD** — no `.github/workflows/*`, no `.gitlab-ci.yml`,
  no GitVerse pipelines, no GitFlic CI. The `scripts/ci.sh` in this
  repo is the only quality gate; it runs locally only.
- **Decoupled Reusable Architecture** — applies recursively. If this
  submodule grows code that another vasic-digital project would
  reasonably reuse, that code is extracted to a deeper submodule.

## Article 2: No Domain Shape

This submodule MUST NOT contain any class, function, file, source-set
package name, or test resource that names a specific tracker, torrent
site, scraper target, or other Lava-domain entity. The submodule is
the **generic** layer; consuming projects (e.g. Lava) bring their own
domain shape on top.

The CI gate in `scripts/ci.sh` enforces this rule mechanically by
greping for forbidden domain-shape tokens.

The `tracker` word itself is permitted in **generic** contexts (e.g.,
"this primitive is useful for any tracker-style client"). Specific
tracker names are not. The CI gate is calibrated accordingly.

## Article 3: Versioning

This submodule uses semantic versioning. The pin in any consuming repo
is **frozen by default**; updating the pin is a deliberate PR. Breaking
changes require a major version bump and explicit consumer migration
notes in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Article 4: Mirroring

This submodule is mirrored to GitHub + GitLab (current scope; 2-upstream
spec deviation 2026-04-30 reduced from the original 4-upstream policy).
The `scripts/sync-mirrors.sh` in this repo handles both upstreams; see
Lava's `scripts/sync-tracker-sdk-mirrors.sh` for the consumer-side
counterpart.

All upstreams MUST converge on the same SHA before any release tag is
cut. The sync script enforces this convergence check post-push.

## Article 5: Local-Only CI/CD

No hosted CI configuration is permitted in this repository. The
`scripts/ci.sh` script is the sole quality gate, runnable on any
developer machine. The pre-push hook (`.githooks/pre-push`) invokes
this script and is enabled via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

Bypassing the pre-push hook with `--no-verify` is forbidden in routine
work and reserved for documented emergencies only.

## Clause 6.L — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate (Operator's Standing Order)

Inherited verbatim from parent Lava `/CLAUDE.md` §6.L. The operator has invoked this mandate **EIGHTEEN TIMES** across two working days. The 10th invocation (2026-05-05, after Phase 7 readiness was reported, when the operator commissioned the full rebuild-and-test-everything cycle for tag Lava-Android-1.2.3): "Rebuild Go API and client app(s), put new builds into releases dir (with properly updated version codes) and execute all existing tests and Challenges! Any issue that pops up MUST BE properly addressed by addressing the root causes (fixing them) and covering everything with validation and verification tests and Challenges!"

Every test, every Challenge Test, every CI gate added to or maintained in this submodule MUST do exactly one job: confirm the feature it claims to cover actually works for an end user, end-to-end, on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, NEVER sufficient. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre.

Inheritance is recursive. Sub-submodules MAY paste this clause verbatim; they MUST NOT abbreviate or relax it.

## Clause 6.O (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.O — Crashlytics-Resolved Issue Coverage Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.O. Every Crashlytics-recorded issue (fatal OR non-fatal) closed/resolved by any commit MUST gain (a) a validation test in the language of the crashing surface that reproduces the conditions, (b) a Challenge Test under `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/lava/app/challenges/` (client) or `tests/e2e/` (server) that drives the same user-facing path, and (c) a closure log at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/<date>-<slug>.md` recording the issue ID, root-cause analysis, fix commit SHA, and links to the tests. `scripts/tag.sh` MUST refuse release tags whose CHANGELOG mentions Crashlytics fixes without matching closure logs. Marking a Crashlytics issue "closed" in the Console requires the test coverage to land first — never close-mark before the regression-immunity tests exist. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05, 2 Crashlytics-recorded crashes within minutes of the first Firebase-instrumented APK distribution (Lava-Android-1.2.3-1023, commit `e9de508`); post-mortem at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-firebase-init-hardening.md`. The operator's ELEVENTH §6.L invocation made this clause load-bearing.

## Clause 6.P (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.P — Distribution Versioning + Changelog Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.P. Every distribute action (Firebase App Distribution, container registry pushes, releases/ snapshots, scripts/tag.sh) MUST: (1) carry a strictly increasing versionCode (no re-distribution of already-published codes); (2) include a CHANGELOG entry — canonical file `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root + per-version snapshot at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>.md`; (3) inject the changelog into the App Distribution release-notes via `--release-notes`. `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` REFUSES to operate when current versionCode ≤ last-distributed versionCode for the channel, OR when CHANGELOG.md lacks an entry for the current version, OR when the per-version snapshot file is missing. `scripts/tag.sh` enforces the same gates pre-tag. Re-distributing the same versionCode is forbidden across distribute sessions; idempotent retry within a single session is permitted. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:11 operator's TWELFTH §6.L invocation: "when distributing new build it must have version code bigger by at least one then the last version code available for download (already distribited). Every distributed build MUST CONTAIN changelog with the details what it includes compared to previous one we have published!"

## Clause 6.Q (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.Q — Compose Layout Antipattern Guard** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Q. Forbids nesting vertically-scrolling lazy layouts (LazyColumn, LazyVerticalGrid, LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid) inside parents giving unbounded vertical space (verticalScroll, unbounded wrapContentHeight, LinearLayout-with-weight wrapper). Equivalent rule horizontally for LazyRow / LazyHorizontalGrid / LazyHorizontalStaggeredGrid. Per-feature structural tests + Compose UI Challenge Tests on the §6.I matrix are the load-bearing acceptance gates. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:51 operator-reported "Opening Trackers from Settings crashes the app" — TrackerSelectorList used LazyColumn nested in TrackerSettingsScreen's Column(verticalScroll). Closure log: `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-tracker-settings-nested-scroll.md`. Pattern guard: `feature/tracker_settings/src/test/.../TrackerSelectorListLazyColumnRegressionTest.kt`. The operator THIRTEENTH §6.L invocation triggered this clause.

## §6.R — No-Hardcoding Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.R. No connection address, port, header field name, credential, key, salt, secret, schedule, algorithm parameter, or domain literal shall appear as a string/int constant in tracked source code. Every such value MUST come from `.env` (gitignored), generated config class, runtime env var, or mounted file. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.S — Continuation Document Maintenance Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.S. The file `docs/CONTINUATION.md` (in the parent Lava repo) is the single-file source-of-truth handoff document for resuming work across any CLI session. Every commit that changes phase status, lands a new spec/plan, bumps a submodule pin, ships a release artifact, discovers/resolves a known issue, or implements an operator scope directive MUST update `docs/CONTINUATION.md` in the SAME COMMIT. The §0 "Last updated" line MUST track HEAD. This submodule MAY add stricter rules (e.g., maintain its own CONTINUATION) but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.T — Universal Quality Constraints (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.T. All four sub-points (Reproduction-Before-Fix, Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges, No-Force-Push, Bugfix Documentation) apply verbatim. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax any of §6.T.1–§6.T.4.

## §6.U — No sudo/su Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.U. Every use of `sudo` or `su` is strictly forbidden. Operations requiring elevated privileges MUST use container-based solutions from the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule or be provided by local project/Submodule dependencies that build automatically. The pre-push hook rejects files containing `sudo ` or `su ` patterns. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.V — Container Emulators Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.V. Every Android emulator instance for Challenge Tests / UI verification MUST run inside a container managed by the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule. Rootless Podman/Docker only. All tests execute inside containers. The §6.I matrix (API 28/30/34/latest, phone/tablet/TV) runs inside container-bound emulators. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.W — GitHub + GitLab Only Remotes (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.W. Only GitHub (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) and GitLab (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) are permitted as Git remotes. GitFlic, GitVerse, and all other providers are forbidden. The 4-mirror model is replaced by 2-mirror (GitHub + GitLab). This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.
