# CLAUDE.md (Tracker-SDK submodule)

This file inherits all constitutional rules from the parent Lava project
at https://github.com/milos85vasic/Lava/blob/master/CLAUDE.md. Read that
file first; this document only adds rules specific to this submodule.

## Inherited rules (binding)

- **Sixth Law (clauses 6.A–6.F)** — all anti-bluff testing requirements.
  Tests in this submodule must traverse the same surfaces a consumer
  touches; falsifiability rehearsals are recorded; capability honesty
  applies (a primitive that exposes a feature must work).
- **Seventh Law (Anti-Bluff Enforcement, all 7 clauses)** — added by
  the parent Lava CLAUDE.md (2026-04-30) in response to the operator
  mandate that passing tests MUST guarantee user-reachable functionality.
  Every test commit in this submodule MUST carry a Bluff-Audit stamp;
  every primitive that claims a behavioural contract MUST have a
  real-stack verification gate (e.g. `MockWebServer`-driven for HTTP
  primitives, in-memory Postgres-driven for persistence primitives,
  real-cluster-driven for clustering primitives where the cluster is
  spun up via testcontainers); the bluff-hunt protocol applies; the
  forbidden test patterns list is binding. See parent CLAUDE.md
  "Seventh Law" section for the verbatim text.
- **Local-Only CI/CD** — no `.github/workflows/*`, no `.gitlab-ci.yml`,
  no GitVerse pipelines, no GitFlic CI. The `scripts/ci.sh` in this
  repo is the only quality gate; it runs locally only.
- **Decoupled Reusable Architecture** — applies recursively. If this
  submodule grows code that another vasic-digital project would
  reasonably reuse, that code is extracted to a deeper submodule.

## Submodule-specific rule: NO DOMAIN SHAPE

This submodule MUST NOT contain any class, function, file, source-set
package name, or test resource that names a specific tracker, torrent
site, scraper target, or other Lava-domain entity. The submodule is
the **generic** layer; consuming projects (e.g. Lava) bring their own
domain shape on top.

CI gate (in `scripts/ci.sh`):

```bash
forbidden=$(grep -rEi --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=build \
  '(<forbidden-pattern>)' . | \
  grep -v 'docs/.*example' | grep -v 'README.md.*Lava project' || true)
if [[ -n "$forbidden" ]]; then
  echo "Domain-shape violation:"
  echo "$forbidden"
  exit 1
fi
```

The `tracker` word itself is permitted in **generic** contexts (e.g.,
"this primitive is useful for any tracker-style client"). Specific
tracker names are not. The CI gate is calibrated accordingly.

## Versioning

This submodule uses semantic versioning. The pin in any consuming repo
is **frozen by default**; updating the pin is a deliberate PR. Breaking
changes require a major version bump and explicit consumer migration
notes in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Mirroring

This submodule is mirrored to GitHub + GitLab (current scope; 2-upstream
spec deviation 2026-04-30 reduced from the original 4-upstream policy).
The `scripts/sync-mirrors.sh` in this repo handles both upstreams; see
Lava's `scripts/sync-tracker-sdk-mirrors.sh` for the consumer-side
counterpart.

## Clauses 6.I and 6.J (added 2026-05-04, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.I — Multi-Emulator Container Matrix as Real-Device Equivalent** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.I. Real-device verification, where this submodule's work requires it (per 6.G clause 5 / Sixth Law clause 5 / Seventh Law clause 3), is satisfied ONLY by the project's container-bound multi-emulator matrix: minimum API 28, 30, 34, latest stable; minimum phone + tablet + (where applicable) TV; per-AVD attestation rows in `.lava-ci-evidence/<tag>/real-device-verification.md`; cold-boot for the gate; falsifiability rehearsal per Android-version-class. A single passing emulator (or device) is NOT the gate — the matrix is.
- **Clause 6.J — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.J. Every test, every Challenge Test, and every CI gate touched by this submodule MUST do exactly one job: confirm the feature it claims to cover actually works for an end user, end-to-end, on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, never sufficient. Adding a test the author cannot execute against the gating matrix is itself a bluff. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre.

## Clauses 6.K and 6.L (added 2026-05-04, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.K — Builds-Inside-Containers Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.K. Every release-artifact build MUST run inside the project's container-bound build path (anchored on `vasic-digital/Containers`'s build orchestration: `cmd/distributed-build` + `pkg/distribution` + `pkg/runtime`), not on the developer's bare host. Local incremental dev builds on the host are permitted for iteration; the gate, the release-artifact build, and the build whose output goes through the emulator matrix (clause 6.I) MUST go through Containers. The accompanying 6.K-debt entry tracks the package additions (`pkg/emulator/`, `pkg/vm/`) that are owed.
- **Clause 6.L — Anti-Bluff Functional Reality Mandate (Operator's Standing Order)** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.L. Every test, every Challenge Test, every CI gate has exactly one job: confirm the feature works for a real user end-to-end on the gating matrix. CI green is necessary, never sufficient. Tests must guarantee the product works — anything else is theatre. The operator has invoked this mandate TWENTY-THREE TIMES across two working days; the repetition itself is the forensic record. The 10th invocation (2026-05-05, immediately after Phase 7 readiness was reported, when the operator commissioned the full rebuild-and-test-everything cycle for tag Lava-Android-1.2.3): "Rebuild Go API and client app(s), put new builds into releases dir (with properly updated version codes) and execute all existing tests and Challenges!". If you find yourself rationalizing a "small exception" — STOP. There are no small exceptions. The Internet Archive stuck-on-loading bug, the broken post-login navigation, the credential leak in C2, the bluffed C1-C8 — these are what "small exceptions" produce.

## Clause 6.M (added 2026-05-04 evening, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.M — Host-Stability Forensic Discipline** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.M. Every perceived-instability event during a session that touches this submodule MUST be classified into Class I (verifiable host event), Class II (resource pressure), or Class III (operator-perceived without forensic evidence) AND audited via the 7-step forensic protocol (uptime+who, journalctl logind events, kernel critical events, free -h, df -h, forbidden-command grep across tracked files, container state inventory). Findings recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/sixth-law-incidents/<date>-<slug>.json`. **Container-runtime safety analysis (recorded once in root §6.M, referenced forever):** rootless Podman has NO host-level power-management privileges; rootful Docker is not installed on the operator's primary host. Container operations cannot cause Class I host events on the audited host configuration. A perceived-instability event without an audit record is itself a Seventh Law violation under clause 6.J ("tests must guarantee the product works" — applied recursively to incident response).

## Clause 6.N (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.N — Bluff-Hunt Cadence Tightening + Production Code Coverage** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.N. Beyond the Seventh Law clause 5 baseline (5 random `*Test.kt` files every 2-4 weeks), bluff hunts now fire IN-cycle on three triggers: (1) per operator anti-bluff-mandate invocation — first/day full 5+2, subsequent same-day lighter 1-2 file incident-response; (2) per matrix-runner/gate change (pre-push enforced via §6.N-debt — owed); (3) per phase-gating attestation file added (pre-push enforced via §6.N-debt — owed). Bluff hunts MUST also sample production code: 2 files per phase from gate-shaping code (canonical list in root §6.N.2: `scripts/tag.sh` helpers, `scripts/check-constitution.sh`, `Submodules/Containers/pkg/emulator/`, `Submodules/Containers/cmd/emulator-matrix/`, the matrix runner's `writeAttestation` function) plus 0-2 from broader CI-touched code. Conceptual filter: "would a bug here be invisible to existing tests?". Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 ultrathink-driven discovery of the 7-day-old `pkg/emulator/Boot()` port-collision bluff that was invisible to all existing test-only bluff hunts. §6.N-debt tracks the pre-push hook implementation owed via the Group A-prime spec (next brainstorming target).

## Clause 6.O (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.O — Crashlytics-Resolved Issue Coverage Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.O. Every Crashlytics-recorded issue (fatal OR non-fatal) closed/resolved by any commit MUST gain (a) a validation test in the language of the crashing surface that reproduces the conditions, (b) a Challenge Test under `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/lava/app/challenges/` (client) or `tests/e2e/` (server) that drives the same user-facing path, and (c) a closure log at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/<date>-<slug>.md` recording the issue ID, root-cause analysis, fix commit SHA, and links to the tests. `scripts/tag.sh` MUST refuse release tags whose CHANGELOG mentions Crashlytics fixes without matching closure logs. Marking a Crashlytics issue "closed" in the Console requires the test coverage to land first — never close-mark before the regression-immunity tests exist. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05, 2 Crashlytics-recorded crashes within minutes of the first Firebase-instrumented APK distribution (Lava-Android-1.2.3-1023, commit `e9de508`); post-mortem at `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-firebase-init-hardening.md`. The operator's ELEVENTH §6.L invocation made this clause load-bearing.

## Clause 6.P (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.P — Distribution Versioning + Changelog Mandate** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.P. Every distribute action (Firebase App Distribution, container registry pushes, releases/ snapshots, scripts/tag.sh) MUST: (1) carry a strictly increasing versionCode (no re-distribution of already-published codes); (2) include a CHANGELOG entry — canonical file `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root + per-version snapshot at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>.md`; (3) inject the changelog into the App Distribution release-notes via `--release-notes`. `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` REFUSES to operate when current versionCode ≤ last-distributed versionCode for the channel, OR when CHANGELOG.md lacks an entry for the current version, OR when the per-version snapshot file is missing. `scripts/tag.sh` enforces the same gates pre-tag. Re-distributing the same versionCode is forbidden across distribute sessions; idempotent retry within a single session is permitted. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:11 operator's TWELFTH §6.L invocation: "when distributing new build it must have version code bigger by at least one then the last version code available for download (already distribited). Every distributed build MUST CONTAIN changelog with the details what it includes compared to previous one we have published!"

## Clause 6.Q (added 2026-05-05, inherited per 6.F)

- **Clause 6.Q — Compose Layout Antipattern Guard** — see root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Q. Forbids nesting vertically-scrolling lazy layouts (LazyColumn, LazyVerticalGrid, LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid) inside parents giving unbounded vertical space (verticalScroll, unbounded wrapContentHeight, LinearLayout-with-weight wrapper). Equivalent rule horizontally for LazyRow / LazyHorizontalGrid / LazyHorizontalStaggeredGrid. Per-feature structural tests + Compose UI Challenge Tests on the §6.I matrix are the load-bearing acceptance gates. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-05 23:51 operator-reported "Opening Trackers from Settings crashes the app" — TrackerSelectorList used LazyColumn nested in TrackerSettingsScreen's Column(verticalScroll). Closure log: `.lava-ci-evidence/crashlytics-resolved/2026-05-05-tracker-settings-nested-scroll.md`. Pattern guard: `feature/tracker_settings/src/test/.../TrackerSelectorListLazyColumnRegressionTest.kt`. The operator THIRTEENTH §6.L invocation triggered this clause.


## §6.R — No-Hardcoding Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.R. No connection address, port, header field name, credential, key, salt, secret, schedule, algorithm parameter, or domain literal in tracked source code. Every such value MUST come from `.env` (gitignored), generated config, runtime env var, or mounted file. Submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.S — Continuation Document Maintenance Mandate (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.S. The file `docs/CONTINUATION.md` (in the parent Lava repo) is the single-file source-of-truth handoff document for resuming work across any CLI session. Every commit that changes phase status, lands a new spec/plan, bumps a submodule pin, ships a release artifact, discovers/resolves a known issue, or implements an operator scope directive MUST update `docs/CONTINUATION.md` in the SAME COMMIT. The §0 "Last updated" line MUST track HEAD. Submodule MAY add stricter rules (e.g., maintain its own CONTINUATION) but MUST NOT relax this clause.

## §6.T — Universal Quality Constraints (inherited 2026-05-06, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.T. All four sub-points (Reproduction-Before-Fix, Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges, No-Force-Push, Bugfix Documentation) apply verbatim. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax any of §6.T.1–§6.T.4.

## §6.U — No sudo/su Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.U. Every use of `sudo` or `su` is strictly forbidden. Operations requiring elevated privileges MUST use container-based solutions from the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule or be provided by local project/Submodule dependencies that build automatically. The pre-push hook rejects files containing `sudo ` or `su ` patterns. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.V — Container Emulators Mandate (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.V. Every Android emulator instance for Challenge Tests / UI verification MUST run inside a container managed by the `vasic-digital/Containers` submodule. Rootless Podman/Docker only. All tests execute inside containers. The §6.I matrix (API 28/30/34/latest, phone/tablet/TV) runs inside container-bound emulators. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.W — GitHub + GitLab Only Remotes (inherited 2026-05-08, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.W. Only GitHub (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) and GitLab (`vasic-digital/*`, `HelixDevelopment/*`) are permitted as Git remotes. GitFlic, GitVerse, and all other providers are forbidden. The 4-mirror model is replaced by 2-mirror (GitHub + GitLab). This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.X — Container-Submodule Emulator Wiring Mandate (inherited 2026-05-13, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.X. Every Android emulator instance the project depends on for testing MUST execute its emulator process INSIDE a podman/docker container managed by `Submodules/Containers/`, NOT be host-direct-launched by Containers-submodule code that runs on the host. The Containers submodule's `pkg/runtime/` (rootless podman/docker auto-detection) brings the container up; `pkg/emulator/` orchestrates the AVD lifecycle inside it. Lava-side `scripts/run-emulator-tests.sh` is thin glue forwarding to the Containers CLI. The container-bound path is the gate — host-direct emulators are permitted for workstation iteration only. §6.X-debt tracks the wiring implementation owed to `Submodules/Containers/`. This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax.

## §6.Z — Anti-Bluff Distribute Guard (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.Z. No artifact may be distributed (Firebase App Distribution, Google Play Store release, container image push, this submodule's binary release, any future channel) UNLESS the corresponding end-to-end tests have been **EXECUTED — not source-compiled, EXECUTED** — against the EXACT artifact about to be distributed, AND have **passed**. Pre-distribute test-evidence file required at `.lava-ci-evidence/distribute-changelog/<channel>/<version>-<code>-test-evidence.{md,json}` with matching commit SHA, timestamp within 24h, `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` (or per-language pass marker) verbatim in captured output. Cold-start verification is the load-bearing canary. Distributing a faulty version is a constitutional violation by construction. §6.Z-debt is open: mechanical enforcement via `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` Phase 1 Gate 6 + pre-push hook check is documented but not yet enforced. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 Galaxy S23 Ultra cold-launch crash on Lava-Android-1.2.19-1039 (Crashlytics `40a62f97a5c65abb56142b4ca2c37eeb` — `painterResource()` rejection of `<layer-list>` drawable); agent had skipped Compose UI test execution citing the wrong §6.X caveat. Operator's 26th §6.L invocation: "Anti-bluff policy MUST BE ENFORCED ALWAYS!!!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.
## §6.AA — Two-Stage Distribute Mandate (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.AA. When an artifact has both a debug and a release variant (or analogous dev-vs-prod build types — including this submodule's binary release if it ships separate dev / prod variants), distribute MUST happen in TWO STAGES with operator-confirmed verification between them. Stage 1 distributes the debug / dev variant only; the operator verifies the **distributed** debug variant on the failure-surface device class. Stage 2 distributes the release / prod variant only ONLY AFTER written stage-1 verification, with the §6.Z test-evidence file appended with a `release-stage` section. No combined distribute permitted by default; the combined path requires explicit per-cycle operator authorization recorded in the evidence file. The R8 / minification surprise class on Android (or analogous stripping / production-only optimization classes on other artifacts) is the load-bearing reason. §6.AA-debt is open: mechanical enforcement via `scripts/firebase-distribute.sh` default flip + refusal of out-of-order `--release-only` + paired `last-version-{debug,release}` per-channel pre-push check is documented but not yet enforced. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 operator directive immediately after the §6.Z forensic-anchor crash on Lava-Android-1.2.19-1039: "for purposes like this one we shall distribute via Firebase DEV / DEBUG version only. Once we try it, you continue and once all verified you distribute RELEASE too!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.
## §6.AB — Anti-Bluff Test-Suite Reinforcement (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.AB. Every existing test + Challenge in this submodule MUST be auditable for the anti-bluff property "would this test fail if the user-visible behavior broke in a way a real user would notice?" Per-feature completeness checklist: rendering correctness (assert dominant color matches expected hue, not just RGB-variance), state-machine completeness (negative tests for forbidden transitions), gating logic (gate fires only on actual completion criterion). Bluff-hunt cadence escalation: every defect not caught by an existing test triggers a 5-file defect-driven hunt of adjacent tests, recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/bluff-hunt/<date>-defect-driven-<slug>.json`. Discrimination test mandatory per Challenge Test: deliberately-broken-but-non-crashing production code MUST cause the Challenge Test to fail. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 Lava-Android-1.2.20-1040 white-icon + onboarding-gate-bypass — both passed all existing tests but failed for the user. Operator's 27th §6.L invocation: "all existing tests and Challenges do work in anti-bluff manner — they MUST confirm that all tested codebase really works as expected!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.
## §6.AC — Comprehensive Non-Fatal Telemetry Mandate (inherited 2026-05-14, per §6.F)

See root `/CLAUDE.md` §6.AC. Every catch / error / fallback / unexpected-state path on every distributable artifact in this submodule MUST record a non-fatal telemetry event with sufficient context to triage the failure remotely. The Android-side canonical entry is `analytics.recordNonFatal(throwable, ctx)` / `analytics.recordWarning(message, ctx)` (lava.common.analytics.AnalyticsTracker); the Go-side equivalent is `observability.RecordNonFatal(ctx, err, attrs)`. Cancellation throwables are filtered automatically. Mandatory context: feature/module + operation + error_class + error_message (truncated 1024, no credentials per §6.H) + per-platform extras. Forbidden: silent fallbacks without telemetry; credentials/tokens/cookies/PII unredacted in event attributes. §6.AC-debt is open: Detekt + Go-vet rules flagging `try/catch` blocks lacking the telemetry call, pre-push hook integration. Forensic anchor: 2026-05-14 operator: "Add comprehensive Crashlytics non-fatals recording all over the apps and API so we can track in the background all warnings, issues and unexpected situations!" This submodule MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax this clause.
